    name: "As-Build Models",
    description:
      "Transform your building's as-built conditions into a precisely drawn 3D model by digitizing and documenting its virtual rendition. As-built diagrams are typically produced during or after the construction phase and serve as a record of any deviations from the architect's original drawings. These 2D documents capture construction details such as walls, doors, windows, millwork, and plumbing fixtures, and can be utilized for future renovations, retrofits, or restorations of the building. We can transform existing 2D as-built documents into 3D BIM Modeling Services, which provide the necessary data to visualize as-built floor plans and any plumbing and electrical fittings. Our team of experienced engineers, drafters, and 3D modelers can make the process of creating 3D as-built models seem effortless. If you provide us with your existing as-built diagrams in CAD or PDF format, we can create a 3D model from scratch that includes precise measurements, dimensions, elevations, textures of various elements, and placement of electrical fittings.",

    description:
      "BIM is increasingly being utilized by MEP contractors, MEP consultants, and Design-Build firms to enhance the design, detailing, estimation, fabrication, and installation of MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) building systems. MEP modeling facilitates collaboration, streamlines projects, and reduces risk and waste throughout the project life cycle. MEP 3D modeling, CAD services, and MEP coordination ensure effective synchronization between all the components of a building. Our MEP BIM modeling services cater to various sectors, including healthcare, residential, commercial, and industrial properties, as well as hotels and resorts. BIM MEP services are essential for ensuring efficient and accurate design, installation, and maintenance of building systems. At NineFive BIM, we specialize in providing high-quality BIM MEP services to clients across various industries. Our team of experienced engineers and designers uses cutting-edge software to create detailed 3D models of building systems, which can be used to identify and resolve potential issues before construction begins. This results in reduced costs, increased productivity, and improved collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the project. Whether you require MEP design, drafting, or coordination services, our team is dedicated to delivering customized solutions that meet your specific needs and requirements.",

    description:
      "BIM is a digital process that involves the creation of 3D models of a building's physical and functional characteristics. BIM services have become a vital part of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, as it enables architects and engineers to create and manage building designs more efficiently. NineFive BIM is a provider of professional and high-quality 3D BIM modeling services to a diverse range of clients, including home builders, retailers, architects, engineers, and general contractors.We take a comprehensive approach to BIM, covering all disciplines, including architecture, interiors, structure, MEPF, and site development, to deliver projects in their entirety. This approach enables the design team to adopt an integrated design approach. Our team of BIM experts is skilled in delivering 3D BIM services from LOD100 to LOD500 for various building types, including commercial malls, recreational parks, hospitals, airports, railways, residential townships, infrastructure, and industrial production plants. We adhere to LOD specifications across the globe to ensure consistent modeling standards.",

    name: "Clash Detection & Coordination",
    description:
      "Clash detection and coordination services are essential for any construction project as they help to identify and resolve potential conflicts between different building systems before the construction process begins. These conflicts could include issues such as two systems occupying the same space or interference between different building systems. Failure to detect these conflicts in advance could result in costly rework, construction delays, and potential safety hazards. At NineFive BIM, we offer specialized clash detection and coordination services to our clients using advanced software tools such as Autodesk Navisworks and Revit. Our team of experienced engineers and designers works closely with clients and other stakeholders involved in the project, such as architects, MEP engineers, structural engineers, and contractors, to develop an efficient and accurate coordination plan. Our clash detection and coordination services involve the creation of 3D models of all building systems involved in the project. These models are then integrated and analyzed to identify potential clashes between different building systems. Our team uses their expertise to evaluate each clash scenario and develop a comprehensive resolution plan. Once the plan is finalized, it is shared with all stakeholders, and necessary modifications are made to the design to resolve the conflicts. In conclusion, our clash detection and coordination services are an essential part of the BIM process that helps to ensure a successful construction project. By partnering withour outsourcing company, clients can benefit from our expertise and experience in delivering high-quality and cost-effective services that are tailored to meet their specific needs and requirements.",

    description:
      "Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become crucial for AEC professionals as it creates 3D digital building models for construction simulation and design evaluation before construction begins. However, creating a BIM model from existing documentation can be a time-consuming process. This is where PDF or CAD to BIM services come in. PDF to BIM and CAD to BIM services both involve converting 2D drawings or plans into 3D BIM models. The process for PDF to BIM typically requires redrawing plans in BIM software to create the 3D model, while the CAD to BIM process involves importing the CAD file into BIM software to create the model. Both processes can be time-consuming and require skilled operators with knowledge of both the original file format (PDF or CAD) and the BIM software. However, these services offer significant benefits in terms of accuracy, collaboration, and cost-effectiveness, making them an essential component of the construction industry.",
